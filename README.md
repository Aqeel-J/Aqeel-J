## 🧠 About Me

I am a Full Stack Software Engineer experienced in designing and developing enterprise-grade web applications using **Angular, .NET (Framework & Core), and SQL Server**.

My work revolves around building structured, business-driven systems using **layered architecture principles** — separating Presentation, Business Logic, Domain, and Data Access layers to ensure maintainability, scalability, and long-term sustainability.

I have hands-on experience working with:

* Monolithic enterprise architectures
* Business-centric domain models
* Stored procedure–driven database systems
* Role-based workflow applications
* Complex approval and allocation systems

I focus on writing code that is:

* Clean and structured
* Performance-optimized
* Business-aligned
* Easy to extend and maintain

## 🏗️ Engineering Philosophy

I believe strong software is built on:

* Clear separation of concerns
* Strong backend foundations
* Optimized SQL and database design
* Well-defined domain logic
* Clean and intuitive UI

My approach is not just about making things work — but making them scalable, readable, and production-ready.
